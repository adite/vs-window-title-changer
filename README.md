# vs-window-title-changer

This is a Visual Studio extension that allows you to set the VS titlebar using an expression.
The expression can use some of the internal state variables of Visual Studio
(e.g.: path of currently open solution file) to compose the title string.

## Installation

You have several options to install this extension:
- In the `Tools | Extensions and Updates...` menu of VS studio search online
  for the "Visual Studio Window Title Changer" extension.
  It's enough to put "title changer" to the search box.
- [Download from the Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2e8ebfe4-023f-4c4d-9b7a-d05bbc5cb239)
